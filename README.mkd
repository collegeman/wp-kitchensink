This projet is an attempt to create a consolidated set of examples for working with the WordPress core APIs.

At present, it includes examples of

* Using the Settings API to create custom preferences screens
* Creating backend UIs without custom stylesheets
* Custom admin menus

The examples are compatible with WordPress 2.9.x and 3.x, and have been tested through version 3.2.1.

## Your contributions are welcome.
